# poly's logmaRNGame

## Overview
A single-page browser-based RNG (random number generator) game built entirely in one `index.html` file. The game features rolling mechanics, statistics tracking, and an inventory system.

## Project Structure
- `index.html` — The entire game (HTML + CSS + JS in one file)
- `serve.js` — Lightweight Node.js static file server for development

## Running
The app is served via `node serve.js` on port 5000. For production, it is deployed as a static site from the project root.

## Recent Changes
- 2026-02-19: Initial Replit setup — added static file server and deployment config.
